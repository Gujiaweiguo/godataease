# Critical API Whitelist for Contract Diff Gate
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2026-02-18
# Change ID: add-go-contract-diff-ci-gate
#
# This whitelist defines the critical APIs that MUST be validated
# in the Java/Go contract diff CI gate.
#
# Field Definitions:
#   - path: API endpoint path
#   - method: HTTP method (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)
#   - owner: Team responsible for this endpoint
#   - priority: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (normal)
#   - blockingLevel: critical (blocks all), high (blocks merge), normal (warning only)
#   - javaStatus: Implementation status in Java (exists, partial, n/a)
#   - goStatus: Implementation status in Go (full, partial, stub, missing)
#   - notes: Additional context
