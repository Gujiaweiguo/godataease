## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Inventory current embedding entry points (iframe + DIV) and map to dashboards, data screens, datasources, datasets, charts, and designers.
- [ ] 1.2 Extend or align embedded routing to support module-level embedding with tree navigation.
- [ ] 1.3 Align embedded token initialization flow and origin allowlist checks for all embed types.
- [ ] 1.4 Implement bidirectional parameter passing hooks for dashboard/screen/chart embedding.
- [ ] 1.5 Update embedded demo or docs to reflect multi-dimensional embedding modes and parameters.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Add/extend tests for embedded token generation and origin allowlisting.
- [ ] 2.2 Add/extend tests for embedding parameter initialization and callback messaging.
- [ ] 2.3 Manual verification with embedded demo for dashboards, screens, module pages, and single charts.
